Following are some changes I'd like to get around to eventually:
* Rename Topic.links to Topic.childLinks
* Unify the search and the topic code.  When there's paging, you should be paging through the topics and then the links on a topic page, which implies a single ordered list, with topics ordered at the start.  What we're doing right now is showing a section of topics and a section of links.
* Check for cycles before adding a parent topic.
* Add in viewer join clauses to all fetching code.
* Add in role directives to the Graphql schema.
* Revisit how the Topic.viewerCanUpdate boolean is evaluated.  Right now we're just looking at whether a repo is private or not.  We also need to take into account things like whether the repo is in an org the viewer is a member of, etc.
